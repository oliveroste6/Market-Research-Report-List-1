<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray FPD Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-ray Flat Panel Detector (FPD) market is categorized into two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion FPDs use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into light, which is then detected by photodetectors to produce an image. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs convert X-rays directly into electrical signals via semiconductor materials, resulting in faster imaging and higher resolution. These technologies are crucial in enhancing diagnostic capabilities in medical and industrial applications.</p></p>
