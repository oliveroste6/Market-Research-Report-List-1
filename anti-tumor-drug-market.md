<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-tumor Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cytotoxic Drugs</li><li>Non-cytotoxic Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-tumor drug market is generally divided into two primary types: cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drugs. Cytotoxic drugs act by directly killing rapidly dividing cancer cells, often leading to significant side effects due to their impact on normal cells. In contrast, non-cytotoxic drugs target specific molecular pathways or cancer cell mechanisms, aiming for more selective action with potentially fewer side effects. Both types play crucial roles in cancer treatment, catering to various patient needs and tumor characteristics.</p></p>
