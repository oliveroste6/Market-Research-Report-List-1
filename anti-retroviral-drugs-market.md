<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Retroviral Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Protease Inhibitors</li><li>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</li><li>Integrase Inhibitors</li><li>Nucleoside Analogs and Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-retroviral drugs market is categorized into several types based on their mechanisms of action. Protease inhibitors block viral proteases, preventing virus assembly and replication. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme through non-competitive means. Integrase inhibitors target the integrase enzyme, disrupting viral DNA integration into the host genome. Nucleoside analogs mimic natural nucleotides, impairing viral replication. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are incorporated into viral DNA, causing chain termination and halting replication. Each category plays a crucial role in HIV treatment.</p></p>
