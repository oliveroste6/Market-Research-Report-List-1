<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fireproofing OSB Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fireproofing Additives</li><li>Fireproofing Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fireproofing OSB (Oriented Strand Board) market comprises two main types: fireproofing additives and fireproofing coatings. Fireproofing additives are mixed into OSB during production, enhancing its resistance to flames and heat. These additives often include materials like intumescent agents that expand when exposed to fire, providing a protective barrier. Fireproofing coatings, on the other hand, are applied as a layer on the surface of OSB, creating a shield that prevents flames from penetrating and reduces smoke emission during a fire.</p></p>
